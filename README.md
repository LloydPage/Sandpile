Code for sandpile model. Runtimes may be atrocious if sandpiles are sufficiently large. Does not autosave files, so saving is left to the user. Needs Python3, Numpy, and matplotlib to run. Only handles 2 directional (up and right) or 4 directional toppling. Leakage is multiplicative, as described in the paper use d=1 for no leakage, d>1 for positive leakage, and d<1 for negative leakage
